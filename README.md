# Ecommerce_purchases
Explore_Ecommerce_purchases analysis is a data analysis project that explores the Ecommerce_purchases dataset, a public dataset that contains purchase data from an online retailer. The goal of the project is to gain insights into the customer behavior, identify patterns, and make recommendations for improving the customer experience.
The project begins with an initial data exploration to understand the structure and contents of the dataset. This is done using commands like head(), info(), and describe() in Python. Once the dataset is understood, the project checks for any missing values or duplicates. Any missing values are handled and duplicate rows are removed.
Next, the project uses data visualization to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset. This is done using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various types of plots, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms. Examples of data visualizations that the project might create include:
#### countplot showing count speakers of Languages
#### A bar chart showing the distribution of Purchase Price by CC Provider
#### countplot showing count of workers in AM OR PM
#### A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between purchase amount and customer age

The Explore_Ecommerce_purchases analysis is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about data analysis or who is interested in understanding customer behavior. It is also a useful example of how to use data science to improve the customer experience.
